Kubernetes Interview questions
==============================


1.  **What is a Container and How Does it Differ from a Virtual Machine?**

    Answer: 
        A container is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, but share the host system's kernel. This makes them more efficient, faster, and less resource-intensive than virtual machines (VMs), which include entire guest operating systems.

2.  **What is Docker and Why is it Popular in Containerization?**

    Answer: 
        Docker is a software platform that simplifies the creation, deployment, and running of applications by using containers. It packages an application and its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments. Docker uses Dockerfiles to automate the deployment of applications in containers, making it efficient and scalable for software development.

**3.  Explain the Concept of Container Orchestration.**

    Answer: 
        Container orchestration is the automated arrangement, coordination, and management of computer systems, middleware, and services. It involves managing the lifecycle of containers, especially in large, dynamic environments. Tools like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Apache Mesos are used for orchestration, providing features like scaling, deployment, and management of containerized applications.
