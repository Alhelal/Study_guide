Kubernetes Interview questions
==============================


1.  **What is a Container and How Does it Differ from a Virtual Machine?**

    **Answer:** 
        A container is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, but share the host system's kernel. This makes them more efficient, faster, and less resource-intensive than virtual machines (VMs), which include entire guest operating systems.

2.  **What is Docker and Why is it Popular in Containerization?**

    **Answer:** 
        Dockeris a software platform that simplifies the creation, deployment, and running of applications by using containers. It packages an application and its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments. Docker uses Dockerfiles to automate the deployment of applications in containers, making it efficient and scalable for software development.

3.  **Explain the Concept of Container Orchestration.**

    **Answer:**
        Container orchestration is the automated arrangement, coordination, and management of computer systems, middleware, and services. It involves managing the lifecycle of containers, especially in large, dynamic environments. Tools like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Apache Mesos are used for orchestration, providing features like scaling, deployment, and management of containerized applications.

4.  **How Does a Container Registry Work?**

    **Answer:**
        A container registry is a storage and content delivery system that holds named container images, available in different tagged versions. Users can push or pull images from the registry, making it a critical tool in the container lifecycle for version control and distribution of container images. Popular examples include Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Google Container Registry.

5.  **What are Namespaces in the Context of Containers?**

    **Answer:**
        Namespaces are a feature of the Linux kernel that partitions kernel resources so that one set of processes sees one set of resources while another set of processes sees a different set of resources. In the context of containers, namespaces provide a layer of isolation by ensuring that containers only see their own processes, file systems, network, and users.
