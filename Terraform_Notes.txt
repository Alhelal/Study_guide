Terraform Notes:
================

	In Terraform, data blocks are used to retrieve data from external sources, such as APIs or databases, and make that data available to your Terraform configuration. With data blocks, you can use information from external sources to drive your infrastructure as code, making it more dynamic and flexible.

	For example, you can use a data block to retrieve a list of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) from AWS, and then use that data to select the appropriate AMI for a virtual machine you are provisioning:

		data "aws_ami" "example" {
		  most_recent = true
		 
		  filter {
		    name   = "name"
		    values = ["amzn2-ami-hvm-2.0.*-x86_64-gp2"]
		  }
		 
		  filter {
		    name   = "virtualization-type"
		    values = ["hvm"]
		  }
		}
		 
		resource "aws_instance" "example" {
		  ami           = data.aws_ami.example.id
		  instance_type = "t2.micro"
		}
